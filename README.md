AI Accelerator Pipeline Simulator
Project Overview
This project simulates a modular AI accelerator pipeline designed to mimic core operations in deep learning accelerators. The framework consists of individual chiplets representing fundamental computation units such as matrix multiplication, convolution, and activation functions. By modeling each step separately and then combining them in a pipeline, this simulation provides insights into latency, energy consumption, and computational behavior of AI accelerators.

The project includes a lightweight Streamlit dashboard to visualize inputs, intermediate results, and performance metrics, making it easier to understand the acceleratorâ€™s operation in a user-friendly and interactive environment.
